## Installation

To get started with **SwiftGeographicLib**, you can download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/MartinMira24/SwiftGeographicLib/releases). Follow the instructions provided in the release notes to execute the package in your project.

### CocoaPods

If you prefer using CocoaPods, add the following line to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'SwiftGeographicLib'
```

Then run:

```bash
pod install
```

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate using Swift Package Manager, add the following dependency in your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/MartinMira24/SwiftGeographicLib.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

## Usage

Once you have installed **SwiftGeographicLib**, you can start using it in your Swift projects. Here‚Äôs a simple example to demonstrate its functionality.

### Importing the Library

```swift
import SwiftGeographicLib
```

### Basic Geodesic Calculation

To calculate the distance between two geographic points, use the following code:

```swift
let pointA = GeographicPoint(latitude: 34.0522, longitude: -118.2437) // Los Angeles
let pointB = GeographicPoint(latitude: 40.7128, longitude: -74.0060)   // New York

let distance = Geodesic.distance(from: pointA, to: pointB)
print("Distance: \(distance) meters")
```

## Examples

Here are a few more examples of how to use **SwiftGeographicLib** in your projects.

### Calculate Geodesic Distance

```swift
let point1 = GeographicPoint(latitude: 51.5074, longitude: -0.1278) // London
let point2 = GeographicPoint(latitude: 48.8566, longitude: 2.3522)   // Paris

let distance = Geodesic.distance(from: point1, to: point2)
print("Distance from London to Paris: \(distance) meters")
```

### Calculate Geodesic Angle

```swift
let angle = Geodesic.angle(from: point1, to: point2)
print("Angle from London to Paris: \(angle) degrees")
```
